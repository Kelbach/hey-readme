  ## Installation
  To install this project, this repo will have to cloned and brought into VS code. Once node is intialized locally in the repo using 'npm init', the command 'npm install inquirer' should be executed to download the proper npm package. Next, in the git command line, type 'node index' to execute. You will be presented with a series of questions and your answers build an object. That object will be used to generate Markdown into a README.md file. Please read the questions carefully and feel free to click away from VS code to copy and paste proper links to contributors.
  
  ## Usage
  This project is only intended to provide a quicker way to generated an organized, professional README file.

  ## Credit
  There were no contributors other than myself.
  
  ## License
  This project is covered under the The Unlicense license.
    
  ## Guidelines for Contribution
  Please be excellent to each other. And party on, dudes!
    
  ## Tests
  The test case that I would often use would involve placeholder names for each prompt. Since the output is a .md file, it can easily be edited after the generation.
